# Visualization Features Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of basic visualization features in the PTX Virtual Machine. These features provide insights into the execution of PTX programs, including warp execution visualization, memory access patterns, and performance counter displays.

## Key Concepts

### Visualization Types
The VM supports three main types of visualization:
1. **Warp Execution Visualization** - Shows the state of warps and threads during execution
2. **Memory Visualization** - Displays memory access patterns and cache statistics
3. **Performance Counter Display** - Shows execution statistics and performance metrics

### Integration with CLI
Visualization features are accessible through the CLI interface using the `visualize` command:
```bash
> visualize <type>
```

Where `<type>` can be one of:
- `warp` - Warp execution visualization
- `memory` - Memory access visualization
- `performance` - Performance counter display

## Implementation Details

### Warp Execution Visualization

The warp execution visualization provides information about:
- Active warps in the system
- Thread mask for the current warp
- Divergence statistics

#### Implementation
```cpp
void Debugger::printWarpVisualization() const {
    // Get warp scheduler information
    const WarpScheduler& warpScheduler = m_executor->getWarpScheduler();
    
    // Print active warps
    uint64_t activeWarps = warpScheduler.getActiveWarps();
    
    // Print thread mask for current warp
    uint32_t currentWarpId = warpScheduler.getCurrentWarpId();
    uint64_t threadMask = warpScheduler.getActiveThreads(currentWarpId);
    
    // Print divergence information
    const auto& divergenceStats = m_executor->getDivergenceStats();
}
```

#### Sample Output
```
Warp Execution Visualization:
-----------------------------
Active Warps: W0 W1 W2
Current Warp (W0) Thread Mask: T0 T1 T2 T3 T4 T5 T6 T7 T8 T9 T10 T11 T12 T13 T14 T15 T16 T17 T18 T19 T20 T21 T22 T23 T24 T25 T26 T27 T28 T29 T30 T31
Divergence Stats:
  Divergent Paths: 2
  Max Depth: 1
  Avg Rate: 6.25%
```

### Memory Visualization

The memory visualization provides information about:
- Memory space sizes
- TLB statistics
- Cache hit/miss ratios

#### Implementation
```cpp
void Debugger::printMemoryVisualization() const {
    // Get memory subsystem information
    const MemorySubsystem& memorySubsystem = m_executor->getMemorySubsystem();
    
    // Print memory sizes
    size_t globalSize = memorySubsystem.getMemorySize(MemorySpace::GLOBAL);
    size_t sharedSize = memorySubsystem.getMemorySize(MemorySpace::SHARED);
    
    // Print TLB statistics
    size_t tlbHits = memorySubsystem.getTlbHits();
    size_t tlbMisses = memorySubsystem.getTlbMisses();
}
```

#### Sample Output
```
Memory Access Visualization:
----------------------------
Memory Spaces:
  Global: 1048576 bytes
  Shared: 65536 bytes
  Local: 65536 bytes
  Parameter: 0 bytes
TLB Stats:
  Hits: 128
  Misses: 4
  Hit Rate: 96.97%
```

### Performance Counter Display

The performance counter display shows:
- Instruction counts by type
- Execution time in cycles
- Cache statistics
- Other performance metrics

#### Implementation
```cpp
void Debugger::printPerformanceCounters() const {
    // Get performance counters
    const PerformanceCounters& perfCounters = m_executor->getPerformanceCounters();
    
    // Print instruction counts
    size_t totalInstructions = perfCounters.getTotalInstructions();
    size_t arithmeticInstructions = perfCounters.getArithmeticInstructions();
    
    // Print execution time
    size_t executionTime = perfCounters.getExecutionTime();
    
    // Print cache statistics
    size_t cacheHits = perfCounters.getCacheHits();
    size_t cacheMisses = perfCounters.getCacheMisses();
}
```

#### Sample Output
```
Performance Counters:
---------------------
Instructions:
  Total: 256
  Arithmetic: 128
  Memory: 64
  Control Flow: 32
Execution Time: 256 cycles
Cache Stats:
  Hits: 48
  Misses: 16
  Hit Rate: 75.00%
```

## Component Architecture

### Debugger Integration
The visualization features are implemented in the [Debugger](file://d:\Projects\ptx_vm\include\debugger.hpp#L12-L57) class, which provides a centralized location for debugging and visualization functionality:

```cpp
class Debugger {
public:
    // Print warp execution visualization
    void printWarpVisualization() const;
    
    // Print memory access visualization
    void printMemoryVisualization() const;
    
    // Print performance counter display
    void printPerformanceCounters() const;
    
    // ... other methods
};
```

### Host API Integration
The visualization features are exposed through the [PTXVM](file://d:\Projects\ptx_vm\include\host_api.hpp#L47-L82) class in the host API:

```cpp
class PTXVM {
public:
    // Print warp execution visualization
    void printWarpVisualization() const;
    
    // Print memory access visualization
    void printMemoryVisualization() const;
    
    // Print performance counter display
    void printPerformanceCounters() const;
    
    // ... other methods
};
```

### CLI Interface Integration
The visualization commands are integrated into the CLI interface:

```cpp
bool CLIInterface::Impl::executeVisualizeCommand(const std::vector<std::string>& args) {
    if (args.empty()) {
        std::cout << "Usage: visualize <type>" << std::endl;
        std::cout << "Types: warp, memory, performance" << std::endl;
        return false;
    }
    
    std::string type = args[0];
    if (type == "warp") {
        m_vm->printWarpVisualization();
    } else if (type == "memory") {
        m_vm->printMemoryVisualization();
    } else if (type == "performance") {
        m_vm->printPerformanceCounters();
    }
    // ...
}
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Visualization Usage
```bash
# Load a program
> load examples/simple_math_example.ptx

# Run the program
> run

# View warp execution
> visualize warp

# View memory access patterns
> visualize memory

# View performance counters
> visualize performance
```

### Debugging with Visualization
```bash
# Set a breakpoint
> break 10

# Run until breakpoint
> run

# View current state with visualization
> visualize warp
> visualize memory
> visualize performance
```

## Performance Considerations

### Visualization Overhead
The visualization features are designed to have minimal overhead when not in use. They only compute and display information when explicitly requested by the user.

### Memory Usage
The visualization features do not significantly increase memory usage as they primarily display existing data structures without creating additional copies.

## Future Improvements

### Enhanced Visualization Features
Planned enhancements include:
1. **Graphical UI** - A GUI-based visualization tool
2. **Real-time Updates** - Live updating of visualization during execution
3. **Export Functionality** - Ability to export visualization data to files
4. **Customizable Views** - User-configurable visualization layouts
5. **Comparison Tools** - Ability to compare runs with different configurations

### Advanced Metrics
Additional metrics to be included:
1. **Detailed Memory Access Patterns** - More granular memory access analysis
2. **Thread Divergence Visualization** - Graphical representation of divergence
3. **Cache Behavior Analysis** - Detailed cache performance analysis
4. **Instruction Mix Analysis** - Breakdown of instruction types executed

### Integration with Profiling
Future work includes tighter integration with the profiling system to provide historical data and trends.

## Conclusion

The visualization features provide valuable insights into PTX program execution, helping users understand:
- How warps and threads are executing
- Memory access patterns and efficiency
- Overall performance characteristics

These features are essential for debugging, optimization, and educational purposes, making the PTX VM a more powerful tool for GPU architecture research and CUDA development.
