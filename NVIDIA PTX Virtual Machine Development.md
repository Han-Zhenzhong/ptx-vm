## 10. Next Phase Development

For the next phase of development, please refer to the detailed plan in [Next Phase Development Plan](docs/next_phase_development_plan.md). This plan focuses on enhancing parameter passing mechanisms, improving the execution interface, and expanding the VM's capabilities to more closely match real CUDA execution environments.
