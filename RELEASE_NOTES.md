# NVIDIA PTX Virtual Machine v1.0.0 Release Notes

## Overview
This is the first official release of the NVIDIA PTX Virtual Machine, a complete virtual machine implementation for executing NVIDIA PTX (Parallel Thread Execution) intermediate code. This release provides a fully functional environment for running PTX programs with comprehensive debugging, profiling, and visualization capabilities.

The project is hosted on gitee at: https://gitee.com/hanzhenzhong/ptx-vm

## Key Features
### Core Execution Engine
- Full SIMT (Single Instruction Multiple Threads) execution model
- Warp scheduling with dynamic thread mask management
- Predicated execution support for conditional operations
- Comprehensive divergence handling with multiple reconvergence algorithms:
  - Basic reconvergence
  - CFG-based reconvergence
  - Stack-based predication
- Synchronization primitive support (warp, CTA, grid, memory barriers)
- Performance counters for detailed execution statistics

### Memory System
- Hierarchical memory model with separate spaces (Global, Shared, Local, Parameter)
- Data cache simulation with configurable parameters
- Shared memory bank conflict detection
- Memory access pattern analysis and optimization
- Memory coalescing optimizations
- TLB and page fault handling for virtual memory
- Configurable cache hierarchies

### Optimization Features
- Dynamic register allocation framework
- Instruction scheduling optimizations
- Memory coalescing optimizations
- Cache configuration flexibility

### Integration Layer
- Host API design for easy integration
- CLI interface for manual execution and debugging
- CUDA binary loading infrastructure (FATBIN/PTX/CUBIN support)
- Enhanced debugging interface with breakpoints and watchpoints

### Visualization and Debugging
- Warp execution visualization showing active warps and thread masks
- Memory access visualization with TLB statistics and cache performance
- Performance counter display with instruction counts and execution metrics
- Interactive CLI debugger with step-through execution
- Disassembly view and register inspection

### Testing and Validation
- Comprehensive unit test suite
- Integration tests for system-level behavior
- Performance benchmarks
- Example programs for demonstration and testing

## Supported Platforms
- Windows (MSVC 2019 16.10+)
- Linux (GCC 10+, Clang 12+)
- macOS (Clang 12+)

## System Requirements
- CMake 3.14+
- C++20 compatible compiler
- Google Test (for building tests)

## Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://gitee.com/hanzhenzhong/ptx-vm.git
cd ptx_vm

# Create build directory
mkdir build && cd build

# Configure with CMake
cmake ..

# Build the project
make

# Run the VM
./ptx_vm ../examples/simple_math_example.ptx
```

## Usage Examples
### Basic Execution
```bash
# Execute a PTX program
./ptx_vm examples/simple_math_example.ptx

# Execute with performance profiling
./ptx_vm --profile output.csv examples/control_flow_example.ptx
```

### Interactive CLI Mode
```bash
# Start interactive mode
./ptx_vm

# In the CLI:
> load examples/control_flow_example.ptx
> run
> visualize warp
> visualize memory
> visualize performance
> dump
> quit
```
