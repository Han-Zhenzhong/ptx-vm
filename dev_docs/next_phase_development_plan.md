## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the next phase of development for the NVIDIA PTX Virtual Machine, focusing on enhancing parameter passing mechanisms, improving the execution interface, and expanding the VM's capabilities to more closely match real CUDA execution environments.

## 2. Current State Analysis

Based on the current implementation, the PTX VM has the following characteristics:
- Supports loading and executing PTX programs through CLI or API interfaces
- Implements SIMT execution model with warp scheduling
- Provides memory subsystem with hierarchical memory spaces
- Offers debugging capabilities with breakpoints and watchpoints
- Includes performance profiling and visualization features
- Supports enhanced parameter passing for kernel execution

Recent enhancements have been made to the parameter passing mechanisms:
- Implemented direct parameter passing mechanisms for kernel execution
- Developed memory management APIs that mirror CUDA's cuMemAlloc, cuMemcpy, etc.
- Created kernel launch functionality that accepts parameters similar to cuLaunchKernel
- Extended CLI with parameter setting commands
- Enhanced Host API with parameter passing capabilities
- Implemented memory inspection and manipulation commands

## 3. Next Phase Objectives
