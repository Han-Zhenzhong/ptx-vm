## Implementation Details

### Divergence Impact Calculation
The divergence impact is calculated as:
```
impact = (divergence_depth * divergence_cycles) / total_cycles
```
Where:
- divergence_depth: Number of active divergence levels
- divergence_cycles: Cycles spent in divergent execution
- total_cycles: Total execution cycles

### Performance Counters Integration
The divergence handling integrates with performance counters:
```cpp
// Performance counter updates in divergence handling
void ReconvergenceMechanism::handleBranch(...) {
    // Record divergence start time
    m_divergenceStartCycle = m_currentCycles++;
}

bool ReconvergenceMechanism::checkReconvergence(...) {
    size_t divergenceCycles = m_currentCycles - m_divergenceStartCycle;
    updateReconvergenceStats(divergenceCycles);
}

void ReconvergenceMechanism::updateReconvergenceStats(size_t divergenceCycles) {
    // Update average reconvergence time
    stats.averageReconvergenceTime = 
        (stats.averageReconvergenceTime * (stats.numDivergentPaths - 1) + divergenceCycles) / 
        stats.numDivergentPaths;
    
    // Update divergence impact factor
    stats.divergenceImpactFactor = 
        (stats.averageReconvergenceTime * stats.maxDivergenceDepth) / 100.0;
}
```

## Integration with Build System
