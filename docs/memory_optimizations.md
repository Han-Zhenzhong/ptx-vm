# Memory Optimizations Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of memory optimization features in the PTX Virtual Machine. The memory system includes advanced optimizations to improve performance and accurately simulate real GPU memory behavior.

## Key Concepts

### Memory Hierarchy
The VM implements a hierarchical memory model with multiple levels:
- Register file (per-thread registers)
- Shared memory (block-level shared memory)
- Global memory (device memory)
- Constant memory (read-only memory)
- Texture memory (optimized for spatial locality)

### Memory Access Patterns
The optimizations focus on handling different access patterns:
- Sequential access
- Random access
- Strided access
- Coalesced vs. uncoalesced access

### Cache Simulation
The memory system includes configurable cache models:
- Data cache with configurable size and associativity
- Shared memory bank configuration
- TLB for virtual memory translation

## Implementation Details

### Memory Space Definitions
The memory system supports different memory spaces:
```cpp
enum class MemorySpace {
    GLOBAL,     // Global device memory
    SHARED,     // Shared memory
    CONSTANT,   // Read-only constant memory
    TEXTURE,    // Texture memory
    REGISTER,   // Register file
    LOCAL       // Local memory (private to thread)
};
```

### Memory Access Optimization
The memory optimizer handles different access patterns:
```cpp
// Memory access pattern detection
enum class MemoryAccessPattern {
    UNKNOWN,        // Pattern not determined
    SEQUENTIAL,     // Sequential access pattern
    STRIDED,        // Strided access pattern
    RANDOM,         // Random access pattern
    COALESCED,      // Coalesced access pattern
    UNCOALESCED     // Uncoalesced access pattern
};

// Memory optimization statistics
struct MemoryStats {
    size_t totalAccesses;
    size_t cacheHits;
    size_t cacheMisses;
    size_t bankConflicts;
    size_t coalescedAccesses;
    size_t uncoalescedAccesses;
    double averageLatency;
    double hitRate;
    double missRate;
};
```

## Advanced Memory Optimizations

### TLB and Page Fault Handling

#### Overview
The Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB) provides fast virtual-to-physical address translation. When a TLB miss occurs, the system falls back to page table lookup, which may result in a page fault if the page is not in physical memory.

#### Implementation Details
```cpp
// TLB entry structure
struct TlbEntry {
    uint64_t virtualPageNumber;
    uint64_t physicalPageNumber;
    bool valid;
    bool dirty;
    uint64_t lastAccessed;
};

// Page table entry structure
struct PageTableEntry {
    uint64_t physicalPageNumber;
    bool present;
    bool writable;
    bool dirty;
    uint64_t accessed;
};

// Memory access result structure
struct MemoryAccessResult {
    bool success;
    bool pageFault;
    uint64_t physicalAddress;
    uint64_t virtualAddress;
};
```

#### Key Features
1. Configurable TLB size
2. LRU replacement policy
3. Page fault handling with physical page allocation
4. Performance statistics tracking (TLB hits/misses, page faults)

### Cache Simulation

#### Overview
The cache simulation models data caches with configurable parameters to analyze memory access efficiency.

#### Configuration Options
```cpp
// Cache configuration structure
struct CacheConfig {
    size_t cacheSize;           // Total cache size in bytes
    size_t lineSize;            // Cache line size in bytes
    size_t associativity;       // Cache associativity
    bool writeThrough;          // Write-through or write-back policy
    size_t replacementPolicy;   // 0 = LRU, 1 = FIFO, 2 = Random
};
```

#### Features
1. Configurable cache size, line size, and associativity
2. Support for different replacement policies
3. Write-through and write-back policies
4. Cache hit/miss tracking
5. Memory coalescing efficiency analysis

### Shared Memory Bank Conflict Detection

#### Overview
Shared memory in GPUs is organized into banks to enable parallel access. When multiple threads access the same bank simultaneously, serialization occurs, reducing performance.

#### Implementation
```cpp
// Shared memory bank configuration
struct SharedMemoryConfig {
    size_t bankCount;           // Number of banks
    size_t bankWidth;           // Width of each bank in bytes
    size_t bankSize;            // Size of each bank in bytes
};
```

#### Features
1. Configurable bank count and width
2. Bank conflict detection and counting
3. Performance impact analysis

### Memory Coalescing Optimizations

#### Overview
Memory coalescing is a critical optimization in GPU computing where threads in a warp access consecutive memory locations to maximize memory bandwidth utilization.

#### Implementation
The system analyzes access patterns to determine coalescing efficiency:
1. Group memory accesses by cache lines
2. Calculate efficiency based on cache lines accessed vs. ideal
3. Provide optimization suggestions

#### Features
1. Coalescing efficiency calculation
2. Access pattern analysis
3. Optimization recommendations

## Memory Optimizer Framework

### Overview
The memory optimizer framework provides a unified interface for configuring and managing memory optimizations.

### Configuration
```cpp
// Memory optimization configuration
struct MemoryOptimizerConfig {
    // Cache configuration
    bool enableCaching;
    size_t cacheSize;
    size_t cacheLineSize;
    size_t cacheAssociativity;
    bool writeThrough;
    
    // Shared memory configuration
    bool enableSharedMemoryOptimization;
    size_t sharedMemoryBanks;
    size_t sharedMemoryBankWidth;
    
    // TLB configuration
    bool enableTLB;
    size_t tlbEntries;
    size_t pageSize;
    
    // Optimization level (0 = none, 1 = basic, 2 = advanced)
    int optimizationLevel;
};
```

### Execution Engine
The execution engine uses memory optimizations to:
1. Analyze memory access patterns during execution
2. Provide optimization feedback
3. Track performance metrics

### Performance Counters
Memory optimization statistics are integrated into the overall performance counters:

    // ... other counters ...
    
    // Memory optimization counters
    size_t tlbHits;
    size_t tlbMisses;
    size_t pageFaults;
    size_t cacheHits;
    size_t cacheMisses;
    size_t bankConflicts;
    
    // ... other counters ...
};
```

## Usage Examples

### Configuring Memory Optimizations
```cpp
// Create and configure memory optimizer
MemoryOptimizerFramework optimizer;

MemoryOptimizerConfig config;
config.enableCaching = true;
config.cacheSize = 32 * 1024;  // 32KB
config.cacheLineSize = 64;
config.cacheAssociativity = 4;

config.enableSharedMemoryOptimization = true;
config.sharedMemoryBanks = 32;
config.sharedMemoryBankWidth = 4;

config.enableTLB = true;
config.tlbEntries = 32;
config.pageSize = 4096;

config.optimizationLevel = 2;

optimizer.configure(config);
```

### Analyzing Memory Access Patterns
```cpp
// Analyze a set of memory addresses
std::vector<uint64_t> addresses = {0x1000, 0x1004, 0x1008, 0x100C};

optimizer.analyzeAccessPattern(addresses);

// Get performance metrics
double coalescingEfficiency = optimizer.getCoalescingEfficiency();
size_t bankConflicts = optimizer.getBankConflicts();
double cacheHitRate = optimizer.getCacheHitRate();
```
